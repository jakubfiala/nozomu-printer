Flying pineapple with a big ribbon
Swimming octopus
Her subconscious
happy flight
moved to a new house
go for a walk every morning
Sainsburyâ€™s
Christmas tree
There are four fire places
Andrea asked me his name
I suddenly remembered that
He stared at me
Christmas tea
There are people swimming in the pond
